# Wuthering Waves、jixwang、Laco – A Splash of True Colors (Throttle Up!)

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Splash the sparks of tires
Got a fiery thought on my mind
Rhythm of heartbeat starts to turn into my inner drive
Left self-doubt all behind
Holding my rebellious pride
No nostalgia regardless how I wanna stay

Time's up, don't you stand in my way

Burning still, we've come so far
Keep on breaking through from where we are
Snapping back, can't give it up
Just throttle up, fore' I take you down whoa

Lost? (I'll be wandering)
Lies (Can you recognize them all?)
Fail? (Retreat is not a choice)
Hold tight

Past? (There's no turning back)
Trust (Am I worthy of it now?)
Pump (Glory's over me)
Forward (Off I go no longer alone)

Back on it
No matter what you're thinking, I ain't taking criticism
Don't tryna slander bout' my standard with your skepticism
Got me stuck in between lies and purism
My frequency's pulsating faster for the fatalism
I'm gonna win it for myself without your recommendation
With all the missions well completed without fabrication
Blaming no one else, don't need no complications
You never know, every moment could be different

Time's up, don't you dare look away

Burning still, we've come so far
Keep on breaking through from where we are
Snapping back, can't give it up
Just throttle up, fore' I take you down whoa

Lost? (I'll be wandering)
Lies (can you recognize them all?)
Fail? (Retreat is not a choice)
Hold tight

Past? (There's no turning back)
Trust (am I worthy of it now?)
Pump (glory's over me)
Forward (off I go no longer alone)

Burning still, we've come so far
Keep on breaking through from where we are
Snapping back, can't give it up
Just throttle up, fore' I take you down whoa

Lost? (Wander 'til the dawn)
Lies (Realizing for myself)
Fail? (I'm never backing down)
Hold tight

Past? (No regret in me)
Trust (I'm worthy all the time)
Pump (Propel me even more)
With you I'm no longer alone
